## Quarto and Rmarkdown

- Quarto and Rmarkdown a special kind of scripts where text and computer code can be combined to generate reports. 
- Under the hood, a report generator is converting code and plain text to an output format such as *html*, *pdf* or *docx*.
- Quarto is a new, [well documented](https://quarto.org/) format that gives extra flexibility, but also requires installation of extra software.


## Code chunks

- Code chunks are sections of your source file containing code. We primarily write R-code, but e.g., python is also possible.
- The code chunk comes with several options specified in the top of the chunk using `#|`, such as:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| error: true
#| include: false
```
````
