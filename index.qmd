## Introduction

Welcome to the course **Quantitative methods and Statistics (IDR4000)**. The course aims to give students an overview of methodological aspects within the field of sport and exercise-physiology. Specifically, planning, conducting and analyzing research projects with human participants will be covered. The lecture notes for the course can [be found here](https://dhammarstrom.github.io/quant-methods/). This website will contain tutorials, workshops, assignments and lectures that we will work on in the course.

### Learning objectives
Learning objectives can be read in Norwegian [here](https://www.inn.no/content/view/full/163709/language/nor-NO).

### Learning strategies
The course will include lectures, laboratory exercises, computer exercises and workshops, seminars and student presentations. Workshops will be held in-person.

Computer exercises will eventually require that you have special computer software installed on your computer. The software is free (see specific chapters in [lecture notes](https://dhammarstrom.github.io/quant-methods)).


## Assignments and Portfolio exam

The course is based on several assignments. Some of these assignments are to be handed in as part of a portfolio exam upon which your grade is based. 

Assignments that are due during the course (arbeidskrav) are expected to be further improved after feedback from fellow students and teachers before inclusion in your portfolio.
