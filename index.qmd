## Introduction

Welcome to the course **Quantitative methods and Statistics (IDR4000)**. The course aims to give students an overview of methodological aspects within the field of sport and exercise-physiology. Specifically, planning, conducting and analyzing research projects with human participants will be covered. The lecture notes for the course can [be found here](https://dhammarstrom.github.io/quant-methods/). This website will contain tutorials, workshops, assignments and lectures that we will work on in the course.

These notes were updated on `r Sys.Date()` and cover the course held during 2024 autumn semester. Contact [Daniel Hammarstr√∂m](mailto:daniel.hammarstrom@inn.no) if you have any questions regarding this content.

### Learning objectives
Learning objectives can be read in Norwegian [here](https://www.inn.no/content/view/full/163709/language/nor-NO).

### Learning strategies
The course will include lectures, laboratory exercises, computer exercises and workshops, seminars and student presentations. Workshops will be held in-person.

Computer exercises will eventually require that you have special computer software installed on your computer. The software is free (see specific chapters in [lecture notes](https://dhammarstrom.github.io/quant-methods)).


## Assignments and Portfolio exam

The course is based on several assignments. Some of these assignments are to be handed in as part of a portfolio exam upon which your grade is based. 

Assignments that are due during the course (arbeidskrav) are expected to be further improved after feedback from fellow students and teachers before inclusion in your portfolio.

You can use the same template for all assignments and further improve this to hand in as your portfolio exam. The template is a quarto book project with each part of the exam structured as a chapter, see and fork this [GitHub repository to get started](https://github.com/dhammarstrom/idr4000-student-assignments/).

The portfolio exam should include: 

- [Assignment 1: Reliability and tools for reproducible data science](assignment-1.qmd)
- [Assignment 2: Regression models, predicting from data](assignment-2.qmd)
- [Assignment 3: Drawing inference from statistical models, and statistical power](assignment-3.qmd)
- [Assignment 4: Study designs](assignment-4.qmd)
- [Assignment 5: Analyzing repeated measures experiments](assignment-5.qmd)
- A selected report from the molecular laboratory
- An assay on philosophy of science (See canvas during week 41)
