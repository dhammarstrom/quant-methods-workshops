    "text": "This assignment is set up as a statistical laboratory, we will perform simulations and your assignment is to interpret and explain the results. Create a report based on the code used in the lab and make sure you answer the specified questions (1-8). You can be as creative as you want and explore the results further.\nThe report should be handed in on canvas as a link to github repository containing a reproducible .Rmd (or qmd) file.\n\n\nIn this assignment we will simulate a population of possible values, from this population we will draw random samples, calculate statistics and interpret them. The population of values can be regarded as the possible differences between two treatments in a cross-over study where participants have performed both treatments. The values in the population are calculate as \\(Treatment - Control\\).\nWe will simulate a population of one million numbers with a mean of 1.5 and a standard deviation of 3. We will make two different set of studies, one set with a sample size of 8 and one set with a sample size of 40. In order to be sure you replicate your results, include and run set.seed() before simulations in your final script.\nWe will use the lm function to estimate the average value of the population. We do this in an “intercept-only” model. This model can be written as\n\\[Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon_i\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept and can be interpreted as the average value of \\(Y\\), our dependent variable. \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term, each observation (\\(i\\)) deviates from the intercept to some degree. If the intercept term is positive or negative we can interpret it as a difference between the two treatments (described above). This model is equivalent to a one-sample t-test. Let’s get started!\nIn the code chunk below, we will simulate the population of differences between treatments. We will then draw two random samples corresponding sample sizes of 8 and 40 and save these data in data frames with the dependent variable named y. We fit the very simple model y ~ 1 as a linear model and save the model object as m1 and m2.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nset.seed(1)\npopulation <- rnorm(1000000, mean = 1.5, sd = 3)\n\n\nsamp1 <- data.frame(y = sample(population, 8, replace = FALSE))\n\nsamp2 <- data.frame(y = sample(population, 40, replace = FALSE))\n\n\nm1 <- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp1)\nm2 <- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp2)\n\nsummary(m1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ 1, data = samp1)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-6.5322 -1.2523 -0.0883  1.3540  4.8692 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)\n(Intercept)    1.840      1.251    1.47    0.185\n\nResidual standard error: 3.539 on 7 degrees of freedom\n\n\nThe results from a simple model can be calculated by hand. The Estimate corresponds to the average of all values in the sample, from the smaller sample, samp1 we can do mean(samp1$y). This average should correspond to coef(m1) which should be 1.84. The variation of the data is most often described with the standard deviation (SD). The SD of y in the smaller sample is sd(samp1$y) (corresponding to 3.539). However, the regression table (summary(m1)) show you the standard error (SE). This statistic is an attempt to estimate the variation in a hypothetical distribution of means. The standard error is (in this simple case) \\(SE_y = \\frac{SD_y}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). Calculating by hand using the data in samp1 we would do sd(samp1$y)/sqrt(8). Amazingly this corresponds to 1.251!\nBy using the estimate 1.84 and the corresponding SE (1.251) we can calculate the t-value as the ratio \\(\\frac{Estimate}{SE}\\). The t-value may in turn be used to determine the are under the curve of a t-distribution. The t-value from the above calculation is 1.4702611. Using our single \\(n=8\\) study, we estimate that values of t, as extreme or even more extreme as our observed value both above and below 0, would occur in 18.5% of studies if the null-hypothesis was true. This corresponds to a p-value of 0.185. The figure below shows a graphical representation of a t-value distribution under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true.\n\n\n\n\n\nA t-distribution estimated from model m1 with the shaded area corresponding to the observed p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn light of what you know now about the process of conducting a study with a random sample, use your own words and…\n\nExplain the estimate, SE, t-value, and p-value from the regression models that we created previously (m1 and m2).\nDiscuss what contributes to the different results in the two studies (m1 and m2).\nWhy do we use the shaded area in the lower and upper tail of the t-distribution (See Figure @ref(fig:t-dist-fig)).\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow we will perform 1000 studies and save the results from each study. This will make it possible for us to get an actual sampling distribution. Copy the code to your own document to run the experiment.\n\n# Create data frames to store the model estimates\nresults_8 <- data.frame(estimate = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      se = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      pval = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      n = 8)  \n\nresults_40 <- data.frame(estimate = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      se = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      pval = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      n = 40)\n\n# A for loop used to sample 1000 studies, each iteration (i) will draw a new sample\n# from the population. \n\nfor(i in 1:1000) {\n  \n  # Draw a sample \n  samp1 <- data.frame(y = sample(population, 8, replace = FALSE))\n  samp2 <- data.frame(y = sample(population, 40, replace = FALSE))\n\n  # Model the data\n  m1 <- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp1)\n  m2 <- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp2)\n  \n  # Extract values from the models\n  results_8[i, 1] <- coef(summary(m1))[1, 1]\n  results_8[i, 2] <- coef(summary(m1))[1, 2]\n  results_8[i, 3] <- coef(summary(m1))[1, 4]\n\n  results_40[i, 1] <- coef(summary(m2))[1, 1]\n  results_40[i, 2] <- coef(summary(m2))[1, 2]\n  results_40[i, 3] <- coef(summary(m2))[1, 4]\n  \n  \n}\n\n\n# Save the results in a combined data frame\n\nresults <- bind_rows(results_8, results_40)\n\n\nUsing the results data frame…\n\nCalculate the standard deviation of the estimate variable, and the average of the se variable for each of the study sample sizes (8 and 40). Explain why these numbers are very similar. How can you define the Standard Error (SE) in light of these calculations?\nCreate a histogram (see example code below) of the p-values from each study sample-size. How do you interpret these histograms, what do they tell you about the effect of sample size on statistical power?\nCalculate the number of studies from each sample size that declare a statistical significant effect (specify a threshold for \\(\\alpha\\), your significance level).\nUsing the pwr package, calculate the power of a one-sample t-test, with a effect size of 1.5/3, your specified significance level and sample sizes 8 and 40. Explain the results in the light of your simulations.\n\n\n\n# Example code for copy and paste\n\n# A two facets histogram can be created with ggplot2\nresults %>%\n  ggplot(aes(pval)) + \n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~ n)\n\n\n# Count the proportion of tests below a certain p-value for each \nresults %>%\n  filter(pval < 0.05) %>%\n  group_by(n) %>%\n  summarise(sig_results = n()/1000)\n\n# Using the pwr package\nlibrary(pwr)\n\npwr.t.test(n = 40, sig.level = 0.05, d = 1.5/3, type = \"one.sample\")\n\n\n\n\nWe will now simulate a population without differences between treatment and control. The code below is very similar to the one we use above, except that we use an average effect of 0 in the population.\n\npopulation <- rnorm(1000000, mean = 0, sd = 3)\n\n\n# Create data frames to store the model estimates\nresults_8 <- data.frame(estimate = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      se = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      pval = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      n = 8)  \n\nresults_40 <- data.frame(estimate = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      se = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      pval = rep(NA, 1000), \n                      n = 40)\n\n# A for loop used to sample 1000 studies, each iteration (i) will draw a new sample\n# from the population. \n\nfor(i in 1:1000) {\n  \n  # Draw a sample \n  samp1 <- data.frame(y = sample(population, 8, replace = FALSE))\n  samp2 <- data.frame(y = sample(population, 40, replace = FALSE))\n\n  # Model the data\n  m1 <- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp1)\n  m2 <- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp2)\n  \n  # Extract values from the models\n  results_8[i, 1] <- coef(summary(m1))[1, 1]\n  results_8[i, 2] <- coef(summary(m1))[1, 2]\n  results_8[i, 3] <- coef(summary(m1))[1, 4]\n\n  results_40[i, 1] <- coef(summary(m2))[1, 1]\n  results_40[i, 2] <- coef(summary(m2))[1, 2]\n  results_40[i, 3] <- coef(summary(m2))[1, 4]\n  \n  \n}\n\n\n# Save the results in a combined data frame\n\nresults_null <- bind_rows(results_8, results_40)\n\n\nUsing the new data frame with results from studies of a population with an average effect of zero, create new histograms.\n\nWith a significance level of 5%, how many studies would give you a “false positive” result if you did many repeated studies?"

    "text": "In this workshop, many of us will create our first real plot. For this purpose we will use the ggplot2 package. This choice is based on usage, many people use it and therefore you can easily find help online. ggplot2 is also integrated or highly compatible with other commonly used packages in R.\n\n\nWe need to start by installing required packages. From the console we can type\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nThis will install the tidyverse package, a package containing many package. On the tidyverse website you can read:\n\nThe tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.\n\nBy using the tidyverse you will adopt a special dialect of R. A dialect that is very efficient and fairly easy to read.\nTidyverse will install ggplot2 for you. Notice that you only need to install a package once. It is therefore not a good idea to have an unconditional install.packages() in your script.\nTo get ggplot2 to start working we need to use another command:\n\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\n\nNotice that I’ve put ggplot2 inside citation marks \". This is optional!\nThe library function loads all function contained in the package to your R session. This means that you can access and use them.\nFor these exercises we will use another package. The exscidata package contains data sets related to exercise physiology. To install it we need a bit more code. Since exscidata is not on CRAN, but on github we can use the remotes package.\n\n# Install package from cran\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\n\n# Load remotes\nlibrary(remotes)\n\n# Using remotes, install exscidata from github\ninstall_github(\"dhammarstrom/exscidata\")\n\n\n# Load the exscidata package\nlibrary(exscidata)\n\nWe are now set to load data into our session.\n\n\n\nThe data set we will use in these exercises is called cyclingstudy. You can have a look at the variables by using the help command ?cyclingstudy.\nTo load data from a package we can use data(\"cyclingstudy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview your understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain the difference between install.packages() and library()\nWhat is the tidyverse, what will we use ggplot2 for?\nWhat does it mean when a package is not on CRAN?\nIdentify at least one numeric variable in the help pages for cyclingstudy, identify at least one categorical variable.\nWhat happend in your environment when you typed data(\"cyclingstudy\")?\n\n\n\n\nA data set can be accessed in multiple ways. We may want to see the data. We can do this by typing View(cyclingstudy) in the console (notice the capital V). Or we can show a couple of rows and columns in the console by typing cyclingstudy.\n\n\n\nThe ggplot function (from the ggplot2 package) takes quite a lot of arguments. However, very few are needed to create a graph. The ggplot2 system uses DATA, a COORDINATE SYSTEM and GEOMETRICAL REPRESENTATIONS. We build a graph by mapping data to different locations and visual characteristics of what is called geoms. This system makes it easy to build different types of graphs using similar syntax.\nWe will start by mapping to continuous variables to points. For this exercise, use weight.T1 and sj.max.\nggplot needs to know were the variables are from, we therefore have to specify the data argument first. Next we map the variables to the x and y coordinates of the graph. You can copy the code below and run it in your R session.\n\nggplot(data = cyclingstudy, aes(x = cmj.max, y = sj.max))\n\nWhat do you see?\n\n\n\nWe have not yet added graphical representations of the data points. These can be added to the plot using the + operator, as we will do below. But what to add?\nThere are many geoms, for an overview go to Help > Cheat Sheets > Data Visualization with ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview your understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify a geom suitable for two continuous variables, that will show individual data points on x- and y- coordinates. What\n\n\n\n\nBy adding, for example, points to the plot, we will be able to see the data. How would you add the geom that creates points to your plot?\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = cyclingstudy, aes(x = cmj.max, y = sj.max)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1: Using the cheat sheet, beside x and y. What other aesthetics (aes) may be added to the plot that will affect the apperance of the points?\n\n\nTask 2: Using pen and paper, draw a figure of the cyclingstudy data using one categorical variable and one continuous variable and hand the figure to the next group.\n\n\nTask 3: Code the figure! Create the figure that the other group has drafted for you."
